# Life Sciences Workshop

## Overview of the life sciences workshop

This workshop is aimed at anyone working in general 'life science' research. The dataset used is a collection of ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) plate files, and centers around reproducible and efficient data processing. However, the tools and techniques covers should be applicable to other common datasets in the broader field.

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop uses a tabular ecology dataset and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis and visualization. There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools.

### Day 1 - Project organisation and spreadsheet best practice for data analysis
Audience: Everyone, including those who do not wish to code

- Introduction to project organisation (teaching: 15 mins, exercises: 3 mins)
	* Motivating examples
	* File-naming and folders
	* Meta-data (internal and external), README.txt, data dictionaries
	* The concept of raw data

- Introduction to spreadsheet best practice (teaching: 15 mins, exercises: 3 mins)
	* What are spreadsheets good for
	* Common mistakes and problems. ‘Forensic bioinformatics’. ‘Horror stories’
	* Best practice principles
	* Consistency and sensible names
	* Dates
	* Empty cells
	* One cell, one datum
	* Rectangular data
	* Avoid colour
	* Validation technique
	* How to save

- Untidy and tidy data (optional … those who wish to code)
	* Untidy examples (follow all rules above, but still ‘untidy’)
	* Tidy concepts and the reason why

### Day 2 -	Data analysis with R
Audience: Those who wish to code

- Introduction to R and RStudio
	* Motivating examples of code vs GUIs
	* What are R and RStudio?

- R Basics
	* Getting help
	* Simple arithmetic
	* Comparisons
	* Assigning variables
	* Functions (built in) … round, sqrt, mean, table
	* Data types and vectors
	* Sub-setting

- Data Manipulation and Plotting
	* Loading data (CSVs)
	* Data-frames … sub-setting and useful function
	* Base plots

- Beyond Base R
	* Loading packages and CRAN
	* ggplot2
	* 4PL fitting with dr4pl
