### 1. Project organisation: Introduction

Notes for exercise: Anything goes. Listen and record anything novel

### 2. Project organisation: Filenaming and metadata

Notes for exercise: Folders are poor ('Stuff', 'etc'), filenames are poor ('d1', 'd2', 'final', 'complete', 'draft', 'december'). What's the copy all about? Which is the latest Word file? 
Will see one more addition to this later plus an example of a good folder

### Teaching online Via Teams



* Create online meeting and send out the link
* Explain camera, microphone and screen sharing options
* Explain that the 'meeting chat' section is a good way to ask questions if they don't want to interupt
* Do a brief survey on background knowledge and experience
* Review schedule
* For exercises and breaks, one approach would be that everyone switch off camera and mic for a set time. As the host, I then switch on after the set time and ask people to switch 
back on. Alternatively, I as the host could leave the meeing and then return, to allow collaboration
* Be clear when sharing the screen to ask people to maximise Teams, and then to minimise when they need to focus on their work (exercises in Excel, coding in RStudio, etc)
* End with questions and next steps
