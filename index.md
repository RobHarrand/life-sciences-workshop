title: "Life Sciences Workshop"
---

Data Carpentry provides workshops on fundamental data concepts, with the aim of proving the required skills to get started with modern data analysis.

This workshop uses a collection of results files from a typical lab-based plate-reader, as seen in most life sciences labs. 

The workshop primarily involves spreadsheet software (such as Microsoft Excel) and R, but assumes no prior knowledge of the latter. Basic familiarity with spreadsheets is expected.

### Structure

#### Day 1 - Projects and Spreadsheets

Day 1 is aimed at a general audience of anyone who uses spreadsheets for their work. The material does not cover *how* to use a spreadsheet in terms of calculations, loading data, etc, as such 
knowledge is generally widespread. Instead, the focus is on how to organise and arrange data files and the data within those files, in order to maximise the transparency and reproducibility of your work.

The lessons and associated episodes for day 1 are as follows,

##### Life Sciences Project Organisation

- [Filenaming and Folders](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/life-sciences-workshop/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/02-project-organisation-filenaming-and-folders.md)
- [Meta Data](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/life-sciences-workshop/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/03-project-organisation-meta-data.md)
- [Raw Data](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/life-sciences-workshop/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/04-project-organisation-raw-data.md)
- [Data Management Plan](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/life-sciences-workshop/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/05-project-organisation-data-management-plan.md)

##### Spreadsheet Best Practice

- [Introduction](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/life-sciences-workshop/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/06-spreadsheets-introduction.md)
- [Guiding Principles](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/life-sciences-workshop/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/07-spreadsheets-guiding-principles.md)

#### Day 2 - Code based Analysis

Day 2 is for those who wish to go beyond the use of spreadsheets for their data analysis, with the introduction of R. The basics are covered, leading
to the fitting of a 4-parameter logistic regression (4PL) curve to typical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) data.
